## TASK - PREDICTION USING DECISION TREE ALGORITHM

### Decision Tree Classifier for Iris Dataset
This repository contains an implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier and code to visualize it graphically using the Iris dataset. The decision tree classifier is a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It builds a model in the form of a tree structure, where each internal node represents a feature, each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents an outcome.

### Dataset
The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community. It consists of 150 samples, each representing an iris flower, with 50 samples from each of three different species of Iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal of the classifier is to predict the species of an iris flower based on these features.

### Results
The notebook provides visualizations of the decision tree classifier at various stages, such as after training, after pruning, and after feature selection. It also provides accuracy scores to evaluate the performance of the classifier.
